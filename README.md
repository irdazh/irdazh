Hi, I'm Daud.

A Bachelor fresh graduate in Statistics from Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia. I **really** want to work on anything related to data, such as Data Analyst, Data Scientist, AI/ML Engineer, or something along those lines. What a shame, tho: I still got no experiences. However, I hope, I can keep learning and pushing through this field. 

So, let's see! :`)
